Magnesium (Mg) is a shiny, silvery-white metal that is known for its lightness
and good machinability. It is the lightest of the structurally used metals and
is characterized by its high strength and low weight. Magnesium burns with a
dazzling white flame.

Pure magnesium is rarely used in structural applications as it is relatively
soft and highly reactive. Instead, magnesium alloys are often used, combining
the metal with elements such as aluminum, zinc, manganese and silicon to improve
its strength, hardness and corrosion resistance. Common alloys include AZ31
(magnesium-aluminum-zinc), AZ91 (magnesium-aluminum-zinc) and WE54 (magnesium-
yttrium-rare earths). These alloys improve the mechanical properties and make
magnesium more attractive for industrial applications.

Magnesium and its alloys are used in a variety of industries, especially in the
automotive and aerospace industries, where weight reduction plays a key role in
energy efficiency. In the automotive industry, magnesium is used for lightweight
components such as engine blocks, transmission housings and interiors to reduce
the overall weight of vehicles. In the aerospace industry, it is used in
components such as aircraft frames and seats to increase efficiency and save
fuel.

Magnesium alloys are mainly used because they are . Magnesium is one of the ,
making it ideal for the automotive and aerospace industries where weight often
needs to be reduced. In addition, the is a great advantage for demanding
applications. With high damping properties, magnesium alloys can also ensure
that components are . Finally, the alloys, especially AZ91, are known for their
. This makes them well suited for die casting or sand casting, for example.

Magnesium is a . Pure magnesium is therefore not suitable for direct
installation, only the alloys. The reactivity also requires , in particular to
protect the metal from corrosion. In addition, the , which is why care must be
taken to take appropriate protective measures during various manufacturing and
joining processes.
