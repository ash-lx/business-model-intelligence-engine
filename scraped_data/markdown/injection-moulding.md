## What is Injection Moulding? The basics and how it works

Injection moulding is a commonly used manufacturing process for mass-producing
plastic parts. In this process, molten plastic is injected into a mould, where
it cools and solidifies to take the desired shape. The mould, also known as a
tool, consists of two halves that separate after the material is injected. Key
considerations include material selection, temperature control and pressure
regulation. After cooling, the finished part is removed from the mould.
Injection moulding enables the production of precise and complex components with
tight tolerances. It is an extremely efficient process widely employed in
various industries such as automotive, electronics and medical technology.
