Copper (Cu) is a chemical element that can be classified as a non-ferrous metal.
The soft and tough non-ferrous metal is one of the first metals to be used in
numerous products and is primarily known for its characteristic reddish color.
Copper is mostly used for alloys such as bronze or brass. It is also suitable
for electrical components due to its high conductivity. Copper is usually
obtained through mining.

Copper is generally divided into two groups: Pure copper and copper as part of
alloys. Pure copper has both very high thermal and electrical conductivity and
is therefore mainly used in applications where this property is essential. These
can be cables, for example. There are also copper alloys. The alloys bronze
(copper-tin alloy) and brass (copper-zinc alloy) are particularly widespread, as
they have improved mechanical properties. Another alloy is beryllium copper,
which is particularly suitable for demanding industrial applications.

Due to its positive properties, copper is used for numerous applications. Due to
its excellent conductivity, pure copper, also known as electrolytic copper, is
the first choice in the electrical industry and can be used in electrical cables
or components, for example. However, its electrical properties can also be used
in the manufacture of solar and wind power plants or motor components. Finally,
copper alloys are mainly used to protect against corrosion. You will find all
the necessary information about our copper alloys in the table below.

Copper is primarily known for two properties: and . Compared to other metals,
copper has the best electrical conductivity, making it the material of choice
for such as power cables or electrical components. Thanks to its excellent
thermal conductivity, copper can also be used in other products such as heat
exchangers or cooling systems such as air conditioning systems. Another
advantage and difference compared to other metals is the that copper already has
by nature. As a result, copper is used not only in the electrical industry but
also in the construction industry, especially for products that come into
contact with water, such as pipelines or roofing.Translated with DeepL.com (free

Due to the difficulty of extracting copper and the increasing demand for copper,
the in recent years. Copper is therefore somewhat more expensive than other
metals such as aluminum, but is essential in numerous electronic products due to
its high conductivity. In addition, copper can be , such as salt water. The so-
called , a greenish thin layer on the surface of the metal, indicates
progressive corrosion. Finally, it is important to note that copper only retains
its excellent properties if it is free from . With recycled copper, special care
must therefore be taken to ensure that the copper remains pure.
