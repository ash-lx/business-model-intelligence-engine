Zinc (Zn) belongs to the group of transition metals, but is more similar to
alkaline earth metals due to its composition. Zinc is characterized by its
bluish-white color and has a brittle structure at room temperature. Zinc alloys
are mainly used, for example, to improve the mechanical properties or corrosion
resistance of other metals. Zinc is usually extracted from the earth’s crust
using the hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical process.

Zinc can be divided into several subgroups, depending on its form. Firstly,
there is pure zinc, which is often used in galvanization, i.e. for finishing and
alloying metals in order to improve protection against corrosion. Copper-zinc
alloys, such as brass or zinc-aluminum alloys, are also used to manufacture
products with particular strength and hardness. Another form is zinc oxide,
which is used as a material additive for the production of rubber or as a
pigment in paints and cosmetics. A final frequently used form is zinc sulphide.
This can be used in the fluorescent industry or as a window material.

Due to the excellent properties and various forms of zinc, zinc is mainly used
for the post-processing of components to improve corrosion protection. Hot-dip
galvanizing is used particularly frequently for this purpose, which can
significantly increase the service life of metal structures, for example. Other
areas of application for zinc alloys include the automotive industry, the
construction industry and metal structures. The following table lists the best-
known zinc alloys with their properties and processes.

The zinc alloy ZAMAK 2 is one of the most widely used alloys. ZAMAK 2 impresses
with its excellent hardness and is also very durable. In addition, ZP2 has very
good strength and machinability. These mechanical properties are mainly achieved
by the special chemical composition. In addition to the majority of zinc,
approx. 4% aluminum, approx. 3% copper and small amounts of other metals are
also used in this alloy. ZAMAK 2 is used for many components, but especially for
parts with tight tolerances or complex shapes.

The zinc alloy ZAMAK 3 is very suitable and the most commonly used alloy for die
casting, because it impresses with its excellent castability and has a low
melting point. These properties make it possible to manufacture products with
very tight tolerances and highly complex shapes with ZL0400. On the one hand,
this increases dimensional accuracy while, on the other, the precise production
also reduces the need for reworking.  
ZAMAK 5 is also a very well-known zinc alloy and is highly resistant to
corrosion. Compared to the other zinc alloys, ZL0410 contains a higher
proportion of copper, which increases the strength, but at the same time some of
the malleability is lost. Besides this, ZAMAK 5 has similar advantages to the
previous alloys, such as the ability to manufacture complex products and its
excellent density. Typical applications for ZAMAK 5 include automotive parts or
electronic components.  
The zinc alloy ZAMAK 7 is a further development of the alloy ZAMAK 3. Compared
to ZAMAK 3, this alloy has a lower magnesium content and is particularly
impressive due to its improved castability. In addition, this alloy also has
excellent ductility and surface quality. These properties make ZAMAK 7 an alloy
that is particularly suitable for thin parts, but also for components with
special requirements such as the need for high formability.  
Zinc is particularly impressive due to its , especially as an alloy for steel
and iron. Certain finishing processes such as can significantly increase the
service life of numerous base metals by forming an oxide layer, which can
therefore be used in environments where components are exposed to severe
weathering and chemical reactions. Another advantage is the of zinc. Zinc is
100% recyclable, making it a sustainable option when choosing a material. By
combining it with other metals such as copper or aluminum, can be created that
can be used in various industries. These include the metal industry as well as
consumer goods and medical products.

Although zinc generally offers very good corrosion protection, especially as an
alloy, protection can be . In addition, care must be taken **not to mix zinc
with other metals such as lead during extraction** in order to maintain the
desired properties. Furthermore, zinc has a compared to metals such as steel or
aluminum, making it less suitable as a building material, e.g. for building
structures with high mechanical loads.
