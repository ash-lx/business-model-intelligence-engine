Chemical burnishing (also known as darkening or browning) describes a finishing
process that is mainly used in combination with fats and oils to create
protection against corrosion. As with anodizing, the protection is created
without the application of a layer, but through transformation. Burnishing
typically produces a matt, dark brown to black surface, which is also very
homogeneous and resistant to bending and abrasion. In addition to its functional
properties, this surface treatment is also often used for decorative purposes,
as it can give workpieces a dark matt antique look.

Brushing also belongs to the surface treatment group and is used to remove top
layers or surface defects and thus deburr, round or polish components. We use
various brushes and pastes that are adapted to the respective material and
therefore achieve very good results.  
This subtractive manufacturing process is used to reduce roughness and create a
gloss. To achieve this, the component is processed using direct current. The
advantages of this process include the absence of mechanical or thermal stress.
In addition, electropolishing can be used for many sizes and shapes, and
material can be removed even in complex areas.  
This finishing process can strengthen the surfaces of metallic components and
meet visual requirements. The glass beads, which usually have a diameter of 0.2
to 2.5 millimetres, are applied to the surface under high pressure. This type of
finishing is gentle on the material and produces a matt-glossy surface. However,
it is important to seal the components beforehand to prevent rust and blooming.  
Slide grinding (barrel finishing) is a special grinding process that is
particularly suitable for small metal parts. The components are placed in a
container together with abrasive media and an additive (compound). The surfaces
are processed with high uniformity and reproducibility by rotation, vibration or
dragging.  
In laser engraving, an engraving is inserted into the workpiece by melting and
vaporizing a laser beam. The depth of the engraving is usually between 10 and 50
Î¼m. In laser engraving, a distinction is made between three types of engraving:
deep engraving, black engraving and white engraving. Deep engraving is
particularly suitable for tool markings or ID numbers where the focus is on high
legibility. White and black engraving is suitable for contrasting workpieces in
order to achieve legible results and at the same time keep protective layers
intact due to the shallow depth of the engravings. In addition to marking
workpieces, laser engraving is also used to create QR codes and produce stamps.  
Lapping is usually carried out before polishing and after turning and milling as
part of the grinding process when finishing surfaces. By using a lapping fluid
and a lapping wheel on which the workpiece is moved in a circular motion, a
uniform amount of material can be removed. The advantage of this process is very
homogeneous machining without grinding marks, and is therefore also used as a
cutting process for narrow tolerances.  
Polishing is used for fine surface finishing. A polishing agent containing
polishing grains reduces the roughness of surfaces through friction and removes
small amounts of material with high precision. This improves the surface
structure and creates a shine. This process is suitable for both metal and
plastic.  
Grinding is used for the surface treatment of hard materials. Grinding allows
excess material to be removed or surfaces to be smoothed and edges to be
defined.  
Hardening is particularly useful for aluminum alloys if the hardness and
strength are to be increased. During hardening, the workpiece is first heated,
adjusted and then quenched in the next step. The improved properties are fixed
through rapid cooling and finally removed./td>

Hot-dip galvanizing is one of many methods of applying a layer of zinc to iron
or steel workpieces in order to create corrosion protection. The workpiece is
completely immersed in molten zinc. As a result, both surfaces and internal
surfaces such as drill holes can be reached. This means that a resistant alloy
layer can be formed over the entire surface of the workpiece and the zinc layer
can be applied on top. Optionally, the duration of the corrosion protection can
be improved by an additional coat of paint.  
Galvanizing is an electrochemical method used to apply metal coatings to
workpieces. Before galvanizing, it is important to prepare the workpiece for the
process, i.e. to grind, polish and clean the surfaces. In the galvanization
process, the workpiece serves as the cathode and the material for the metal
coating as the anode. By converting electrolytes into metal ions, an even
coating can be achieved on the workpiece by depositing the metal ions on it.
Galvanizing can be used for corrosion protection as well as for changing the
appearance and technical properties of the workpiece.  
During annealing, the workpiece is heated to a certain temperature, held there
and then slowly cooled. The aim of this heat treatment is to change various
properties of the workpiece, such as strength and toughness. In addition, better
flexibility and machinability are often achieved.  
Curing is a manufacturing process in which a component is heated to a high
temperature in order to specifically change its structure. After the workpiece
has been held in the new shape for a certain period of time, it is quickly
cooled down. As a result, the workpiece becomes harder and stronger. The three
most important curing processes are transformation curing, precipitation curing
and work curing.  
Nitriding is one of the surface hardening manufacturing processes that changes
the chemical composition of the workpiece. In this thermochemical process,
nitrogen is added to the steel of the workpiece either in a salt bath or in a
furnace with a gas atmosphere, causing it to form a very hard compound layer on
the surface. The underlying diffusion layer, consisting of the embedded
nitrogen, has a positive effect on the fatigue and wear resistance of the
workpiece. The geometric properties of the component are also retained, but
nitriding requires prior cleaning of the workpiece and also reacts relatively
unstable to pressure in terms of surface area.  
Surface hardening is closely related to the classic hardening process, but only
refers to the surface layer or surface. The aim of surface hardening is to
significantly increase the hardness of the surface and fatigue strength and thus
make it more resistant to wear. A distinction can be made here between processes
without changing the chemical composition, e.g. flame hardening, and processes
with changes to the chemical composition, e.g. nitriding.  
Anodizing (electrical oxidation of aluminium) describes the manufacturing
process in which an oxidic protective layer is created on an aluminium
workpiece. In contrast to other protective layers, e.g. using electroplating
technology, anodizing does not apply any additional material to the base
aluminium, but instead converts the top layer of the aluminium into an oxide
using direct current. This results in a thin layer that protects against
corrosion and is highly resistant to weathering. An anodizing process can also
be used for colouring, which means that anodizing can also be used for
decorative purposes.

Enameling is an additive manufacturing process in which the pre-treated
workpiece is coated with one or more layers of a combination of inorganic
materials. Workpieces made of metal or glass are particularly suitable for this.
The enamel layer usually consists of silicates (inorganic materials) and oxides
(oxygen compounds). The base layer is fused to the base metal or glass at a high
temperature and the remaining top layers are applied on top. The advantage of
this manufacturing process is the decorative embellishment of the workpiece, as
well as the electrical insulation and thermal resistance that can be achieved by
the protective layer.  
Similar to hard chrome plating, hard anodizing is always used when the highest
possible wear resistance is required. With hard anodizing, the oxide layer of
the aluminium becomes even thicker and more resistant than with normal
anodizing, and is similar to comparable but significantly more cost-intensive
steel workpieces with equivalent properties. Hard anodizing can therefore
compensate for deficits in the material and increase quality in a cost-effective
manner.  
Varnishing is one of the most important additive finishing processes for coating
workpieces. The varnish can be applied for industrial purposes using different
processes. The four most important processes are electrical spraying, mechanical
spraying, casting, rolling and dipping. The varnish used consists of different
compositions and can be adapted depending on the area of application. Basically,
it consists of binders, pigments, solvents and thinners, fillers and additives.
The latter in particular are very flexible and can be adapted to the
requirements of hardness, color and gloss, for example. Before a workpiece can
be coated, a suitable surface must first be created. This is possible in
combination with chemical and mechanical cleaning. The possible applications of
varnishing are almost unlimited and cover all industries.  
Phosphating is a chemical surface treatment in which the cleaned metal workpiece
is coated with a phosphate liquid. The chemical reaction between the metal and
the phosphate solution creates a highly resistant conversion layer that provides
good corrosion protection and also improves the sliding and adhesive properties.
Phosphating is often used to prepare a workpiece for further surface treatments
such as varnishing, as varnishing achieves significantly better results on
phosphated surfaces.  
Powder coating is an electrostatic coating process in which the paint powder is
distributed on the workpiece by the conductive materials. Subsequent heat
treatment cross-links the paint powder on the surface so that it adheres in the
long term. Powder coating, usually using a spray gun, can only begin once the
surface has been cleaned of all impurities and prepared for the powder coating.
Careful pre-treatment prevents deficits in quality, such as paint peeling, and
at the same time improves corrosion protection and protection against scratches
and other effects. Powder coating can be carried out automatically and in all
color variations, and is suitable for household appliances, for example.
