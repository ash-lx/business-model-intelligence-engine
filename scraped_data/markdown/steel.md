Steel is an alloy consisting mainly of iron. In addition, the carbon content is
usually between 0.2% and 2.1%. This added carbon improves the mechanical
properties compared to pure iron. Typical characteristics of steel are its high
strength and hardness. The production of steel involves the melting of pig iron
and subsequent refining. As steel has a relatively low corrosion resistance by
nature, it is often further refined into stainless steel by alloying it with
materials such as nickel, chromium or molybdenum. Steel can be divided into
different categories. Depending on the grade, carbon steel varies in the amount
of carbon added, which can change the properties of the steel, such as its
strength. Alloyed or stainless steel is characterized by the addition of various
elements that can significantly improve corrosion protection and heat
resistance, for example. Tool steel is known for its particularly high hardness
and wear resistance and is therefore used for demanding applications. Steel is
used in many branches of industry. In construction, steel can be particularly
useful due to its high stability, while in mechanical engineering it is valued
for its hardness. Tool steel is also very suitable for (cutting) tools due to
its high resistance.

S235JR structural steel is one of the most common types of steel used in the
construction industry. This is mainly due to the fact that it has very good
formability and weldability and also impresses with its excellent strength.
However, as the material 1.0038 does not have a passive layer, it is only very
poorly protected against corrosion, which can be improved by an additional
alloy. Suitable for applications with high mechanical requirements as well as
with multiple weld seams.

The unalloyed quenched and tempered steel C45 is characterized by very high wear
resistance and strength, making it particularly suitable for applications with
high demands on the material and component. Although 1.0503 steel can be easily
machined using all production processes, it cannot be welded. Hardening and
tempering are particularly suitable heat treatment methods for this steel.  
Similar to the previous steel, grade C40 is also ideal for applications where
the component is subject to high stresses, as C40 has a high level of strength.
The unalloyed steel 1.0511 also has very good mechanical properties, giving it
excellent formability and cutting properties.  
The unalloyed structural steel S355J2G3 impresses with its very good dimensional
stability. It can also be welded using all common processes. However, steel
1.0570 is not suitable for hardening, if at all for case hardening. What makes
this steel grade special is that it can withstand high loads at low temperatures
without any problems.  
The cold work tool steel 90MnCrV8 has good machinability and is one of the most
widely used tool steels. Thanks to its very good core hardness and excellent
surface hardness, the steel is extremely wear-resistant and durable, making it
perfect for tools and as a knife steel. 1.2842 is oil-hardenable, but not
weldable.  
16MnCr5 is a case-hardening steel that boasts high machinability and wear
resistance. In addition, the steel is particularly suitable for highly stressed
components in mechanical engineering, as it has a high strength. The steel
1.7131 is not weldable and has only moderate corrosion protection, so an alloy
is recommended for this steel.  
The heat-resistant tempered steel 25CrMo4 impresses with its high resistance and
toughness. Like 1.7131, 1.7218 is also resistant to high loads and is therefore
used in industries such as the automotive industry and mechanical engineering.
The steel is also weldable and very weather-resistant.  
The alloyed heat-treated steel shines with its high strength and toughness.
These mechanical properties make it particularly suitable for highly stressed
components such as axles or large parts in the aviation industry. 1.7225 is not
so easy to weld, but is very easy to harden.  
The structural steel S275JR is frequently used in the construction industry. Its
mechanical properties, such as good formability, make it very practical for all
applications. In addition, 1.0044 also impresses with its good weldability. As
this steel does not have a passive layer, an additional alloy is recommended for
corrosion protection.  
This unalloyed structural steel is characterized by its mechanical properties
such as increased hardness and strength and is therefore also suitable for use
in highly stressed applications. This is the case, for example, in bridge
construction or for other steel structures. S235J2 differs only slightly from
standard 235, only the hardness is improved.  
The cold-rolled steel DC01 is also known as St12 or bright steel. It is
particularly suitable for all components in the sheet metal group, whether
partition walls in cabinets or thin and smooth surfaces for other applications.
The steel 1.0330 also has excellent weldability and very good formability. As
this steel grade is particularly uniform in its quality and properties, it is
ideal for all post-processing and processes such as bending or lasering.  
This steel grade is particularly characterized by the fact that it is very easy
to harden. Hardening can improve mechanical properties and, in particular,
resistance and surface hardness. Other features of 1.1191 steel are its good
weldability and machinability. This steel is suitable, for example, for the
production of small parts such as sturdy screws.  
This cold work steel has a chromium content of 12% and is very strong. Due to
the chromium layer, the steel is particularly well protected against corrosion
and is therefore rustproof. Although it is easy to polish, the steel should not
be welded. It is also very suitable for hardening and can be used in many
applications.  
100MnCrW4 is a cold work steel that also has a comparatively high chromium
content. The material 1.2510 impresses with its excellent toughness and wear
resistance and is also very stable in its shape, even after heat treatment. Its
excellent robustness makes this steel ideal for tools and knives. It is only
oil-hardenable and only moderately machinable.  
Steel is a material that is . Due to its high strength in particular, steel is
such as impacts or loads, which is why it is often used for structures in
construction or car bodies. Another advantage of steel is its . Thanks to the
ideal composition of the material, products made of steel can be manufactured in
a using all manufacturing processes such as CNC milling, turning or casting and
also sheet metal processing. In addition, steel is also known for being to
produce, unlike other metals. This makes steel a not only for large construction
projects, but also for small quantities and components. Finally, steel is also
suitable as a material because it is not only , but can also be using various
alloys such as chromium to improve positive properties such as corrosion
protection.

Depending on the complexity of the alloy, stainless steel to produce than steel
or other types of metal. However, the durability of stainless steel usually
means that these additional costs are quickly amortized. In addition, when using
stainless steel, care must be taken to observe the of the respective stainless
steel type and only use and care to prevent damage to the corrosion protection.
