Stainless steel alloys exhibit good temperature and corrosion resistance as well
as high elongation and tensile strength. Additionally, they are characterized by
good weldability and formability. Some commonly used alloys include:

We offer the following post-processing methods for refinement, strengthening,
and protection against corrosion:

Sheet metal processing is a significant manufacturing technology for
transforming flat sheets into diverse forms. Various processes such as cutting,
bending, punching and welding are employed. The choice of the appropriate
process depends on factors such as sheet metal type, thickness, and specific
requirements. Sheet metal processing is used to create complex components and
assemblies such as housings, frames, body parts, electronic components and more.
The technology finds widespread application in various industries, from
automotive to electronics.
