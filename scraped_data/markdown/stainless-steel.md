Stainless steel, also known as rustproof steel, is an iron alloy consisting
mainly of iron and at least 10.5% chromium. The chromium forms a passive layer
of chromium oxide, which prevents further corrosion and gives the steel its
characteristic rust resistance.

Stainless steel often also contains other elements such as nickel, molybdenum or
nitrogen, which improve its properties such as malleability, strength and
temperature resistance. There are different types of stainless steel, which have
different properties depending on their composition and treatment.

Stainless steel is used in many industrial sectors, including architecture, the
automotive industry, medical technology and food processing, as it is durable,
easy to clean and hygienic. The exact properties and compositions of stainless
steel are defined in standards such as DIN EN 10088.

1.4301 is a relatively soft, non-ferromagnetic austenitic steel. It is highly
resistant to corrosion under natural environmental influences. It is also
characterized by good weldability, formability and polishability. Unsuitable for
applications in chloride-containing environments and salt water.  
---  
In contrast to 1.4301 steel, it is more resistant to chloride-containing
environments and salt water, making it suitable for shipbuilding applications.
It has good ductility and is also easy to weld and polish.  
The steel alloy 1.4404 impresses with good temperature and corrosion resistance
as well as high elongation and tensile strength.  
Stainless steel 1.4401 is one of the most common grades used. Like the
specifications of 316 stainless steel, 1.4401 stainless steel stands out due to
its high corrosion resistance. It is basically very similar to 304 stainless
steel, but differs in that it contains 2-3% molybdenum.  
1.4305 is characterized by the fact that it is the easiest stainless steel to
machine. This is made possible in particular by the proportion of sulphur in its
composition. However, the higher proportion of sulphur compared to other grades
also has the effect of reducing corrosion resistance and strength.  
This martensitic stainless steel 1.4542 is particularly corrosion-resistant and
generally comparable to stainless steel 304. It has a high hardness and strength
and is suitable for use in a wide range of industries, such as the food and
chemical industries.  
Due to its alloy, stainless steel is characterized by a . This protection is
achieved by a higher chromium content compared to normal steel. High-quality
stainless steel is and can provide reliable if cleaned correctly. Stainless
steel is also known for its hygienic advantages. Due to its , e.g. in contact
with food, and its to weathering, stainless steel is particularly suitable for
products in the household sector or in industries with contact to liquids and
extreme conditions, e.g. in the beverage industry or in shipbuilding.

Depending on the complexity of the alloy, stainless steel can be to produce than
steel or other metals. However, the durability of stainless steel usually means
that these additional costs are . In addition, when using stainless steel, care
must be taken to ensure that the of the respective stainless steel grade is
observed and that only are used for cleaning and maintenance in order to prevent
damage to the corrosion protection.
