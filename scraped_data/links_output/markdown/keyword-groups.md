With this function we try to classify and sort a domains’ keywords into groups,
in a useful manner. Taking a look at these groups will help you to quickly get
an of the keyword-focus for the domain.

The table of the Keyword Groups offers the following options:

  * : the terms which have been found in the domain’s keywords ordered according to their frequency.
  * : the total amount of keywords that contain that term.

If you want to take a look at exactly which keywords are in each group, just
click on the “Show keywords” for the group in question.

The two buttons on the top right corner of the screen will allow you to the page
as a PDF (using some ) or share it on Social Media.
