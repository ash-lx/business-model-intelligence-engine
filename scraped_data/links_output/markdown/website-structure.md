The feature called “Website structure” offers more transparency for large
websites. It makes it possible to quickly discover how the structure of a domain
is organised.

Understanding the structure of large, complex websites is often a complex task.
To make this process easier, SISTRIX shows a for all domains.

The feature graphically shows how the are distributed on the domain. Individual
paths can be visualised in detail and expanded by clicking on them.

A maximum of 10 directories are displayed, while the rest is grouped and
partially expandable. Unknown URLs or directories, however, are grouped together
and cannot be expanded.
